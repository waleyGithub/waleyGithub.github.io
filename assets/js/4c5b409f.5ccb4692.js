She has just over one hour until her next seminar starts and for this gap she has booked herself a study space in the library to work on a project that is due soon.

Luckily, Yuxin has EatUoY, the campus food delivery app, installed on her phone. On the app she quickly finds the Piazza restaurant, which has very positive overall reviews. Yuxin feels motivated and takes a look at the menu, where she can see ratings of the different items available. The teriyaki burger foronly \xa35 looks delicious and is rated 4.8 out of 5 stars. Yuxin decides that thisburger would make a perfect lunch together with a coke. The app allows her to pick her booked study space as the delivery location and with her university emailaddress she can log in, which saves her entering any more details. Yuxin paysby card and her order is placed successfully. The app lets Yuxin know her lunch will be at the chosen delivery location in 25 minutes. She feels relieved and is happy about the fast delivery. There is also a function for live delivery tracking, which she checks from time to time while working on her project in the library. Her lunch arrives right on time and Yuxin eats her burger. Her fellow students and the reviews were right: The teriyaki burger is very tasty.

The detected problem describes the missing function of deleting an item from the basket. This violates heuristic 17 of Petrie & Power, because users will expect to be able to edit the basket by adding or deleting as many items as they like or changing their mind on items they have previously added. It may also happen that a user adds an item to the basket by mistake, so it has to be easy to recover from this mistake. The proposal for redesign in this case is to add a bin icon next to each item of the basket . The interaction will be improved by preventing users from making unconscious slips. By decreasing the quantity of a basket item to zero it will not automatically disappear from the basket, which may accidentally happen by tapping the minus too many times."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Problem no. 2 is concerned with the interaction flow from selecting to paying of the first component of functionality. Here we see heuristics 14 and 16 of Petrie & Power violated because the sequence of interaction is illogical and doesn\u2019t follow established web conventions. The current process flow can be hardly confusing to the extent that it creates a gulf of execution when the user wants to view the basket but it is not clear how to get back to the basket from the order detail screen. Therefore, we suggest to improve the interaction flow between the restaurant menu screen and the payment screen.
